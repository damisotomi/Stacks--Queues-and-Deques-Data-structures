# Stacks--Queues-and-Deques-Data-structures

My implementation of the three data structures taught in Linkedin's Free course on data structures; Stacks, Queues and Deques

After implementing the data structures, I decided to apply them solving some common problems

Used the Queue data structure to solve a print queue problem.

Used the Deque data structue to create a palindrome checker function

All linear abstract data types were implemented using pythons built in data structure; list
