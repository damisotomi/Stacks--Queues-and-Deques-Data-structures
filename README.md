# Stacks--Queues-and-Deques-Data-structures
My implementation of the three data structures taught in Linkedin's Free course on data structures; Stacks, Queues and Deques

After implementing the data structures, I decided to use the implementation to solve common problems with them

Used the Queue data structure to solve a print queue problem
Used the Deque data structue to create a palindrome checker function


All linear abstract data types were implemented using pythons built in data structure; list
